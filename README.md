# Welcome to My GitHub!

## Who I Am

Hello, I'm Shavaine Brown, a passionate developer who enjoys learning about new technologies and creating engaging experiences on the web. I believe in using the latest technologies to create innovative and efficient solutions for various projects. With a strong foundation in Full-Stack Web Developement and a keen eye for detail, I strive to deliver high-quality web applications that make a difference.

## My Technology Stack 🧰

- **Typescript:** I am a firm believer in the power of Typescript. Its strong typing system and advanced tooling help me catch bugs early in the development process, resulting in more robust and maintainable code.

- **Next.js:** As my go-to framework, Next.js allows me to build scalable and performant web applications with ease. Its server-side rendering capabilities and developer-friendly features make it a joy to work with.

- **Tailwind CSS:** I love using Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach to styling. With Tailwind, I can quickly create stunning, responsive interfaces without the need for complex CSS classes.

- **Prisma:** When it comes to working with databases, Prisma is my top choice. Its intuitive ORM simplifies database interactions, allowing me to focus on building features and bringing my projects to life.

- **PostgreSQL/SQLite:** Depending on the project's needs, I choose between PostgreSQL for its robustness, scalability, and feature-rich capabilities, or SQLite for lightweight projects or development environments.

### Under The Hood:
HTML - CSS - JavaScript - React.js - Node.js

### Notable inclusions:
C# - Python - Flask - Firebase - MongoDB

## My Projects
